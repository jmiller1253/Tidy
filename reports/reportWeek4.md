## Weekly status report 1

## Team report    
**Goals from a week ago:**  
Our goals were to work on the requirements document, expand more on the specific roles of each team member, and decide on the specific software toolset.  
**Progress and issues:**  
We worked the requirements document collectively, and the team members tackling the backend had an additional separate meeting to discuss the toolset we are using. When creating the use cases we thought about features that weren’t part of the initial design. Yet, we are thinking about implementing some of them, and have others as stretch goals depending on our timeline. We haven’t run into any issues until now.   
**Plans and future goals:**  
**Short term:**    
Work on the system architecture and design assignment- all team members. (4/26/2020)  
Meeting to split the front end work- all team members. (4/26/2020)  
Review of the system architecture assignment before submission- all team members (4/28/2020)  
Start working on the front end- front end and flexible people. (4/29/2020)  
**Long term:**  
Low-fidelity UI complete by (5/1/2020)    

## Contributions of individual team members  
All team members worked on the completion and review of the requirements assignment (that is why we aren’t digging into the details). 
Jacob, Salma, Kcee, and John are going to start working on the front end after the 26th meeting.  
Nick and Daniel are working on the backend.
