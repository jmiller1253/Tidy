**Long term:**

**Progress and issues:**  
We continued to work on the requirements document, and added Architecture and Design sections. Frontend and backend subsections were added, and worked on by the respective team.

**Plans and future goals:**  
Frontend:
<TODO>

Backend:
For the next week, the entire backend team will be focused on learning how Firebase/Firestore works and can be integrated into the main project. Google provides a number of good examples for this, so it should be reasonable to make significant progress within a week.

## Contributions of individual team members  
All team members worked on improving the requirements doc.
We more officially split into frontend and backend teams, so the contributions will be divided as such from now on.
